                            Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I was born in Japan, spent my formative years in the Philippines and Africa, high school in Illinois and Virginia, and university in California - which is where I currently reside. As such, I am a multicultural citizen of the world!
                        </p>

                        <p id="▉▊para2">
                            I am a huge nerd. I love tabletop games. Card games such as <span class="emphasis">Magic: The Gathering</span> and board games like <span class="emphasis"></span>Settlers of Catan</span>. I am into video games like Pokémon and indie games like <span>Terraria</span>, <span>Stardew Valley</span>, and <span>Minecraft</span>, although I'm unsure if that last one can be considered indie after being aquired by Microsoft... As you can see, I like games. I like other things too, however. Drawing, swimming, cooking, comic books, movies, and coding, to name a few.

                        <p id="▉▊para3">
                            I like solving problems and working in teams, as well as learning new things, such as coding and design. I have always been drawn to creative outlets like drawing, but at the same time I have always had a very logical mind. I think these two traits will serve me well as a web developer.
